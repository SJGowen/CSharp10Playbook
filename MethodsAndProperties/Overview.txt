Protect against bugs:
 * Guard clauses

Simpler Code:
 * Writing fluent methods
 * Choosing property types (auto-implemented, expression-bodied etc)

Returning multiple values

Performance:
 * Passing value types by reference


Passing by Reference
 * Declare as in:
   * Do this if by reference is just for Performance
   void DoSomething(in MyValueType data) { }

 * Declare as ref:
   * Do this if you want to modify the value in the caller
   void DoSomething(ref MyValueType data) { }

 * Declare as out:
   * Do this to use the value as a return value
   void DoSomething(out MyValueType data) { }
